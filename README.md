# WeatherApp
This is a simple web application project that allows users to search for current weather conditions and displays relevant data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an associated image for the searched city. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data and the Unsplash API for retrieving city images. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface and handle API requests and responses.
